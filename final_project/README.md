## Description
3D "Shadow" Box is an interactive Three.js scene that transforms 3D objects into striking 2D shadow visuals inside a simple cube.
Drop in a model, spin the box, and watch the shadows come alive.
A tiny stage for light, motion, and playful experimentation.

## Initial
You don’t need to download or install anything to try it out.
Simply open the scene by visiting [this link](https://lw99966.github.io/cs460student/final_project/).

## Use
It is easy to use:
1. The default scene loads with a small house model.
2. Click “Switch test objects” to swap the house for a cat.
3. Click “Switch box” to switch the entire box invisible so you can see inside.
4. You can also click any individual wall to toggle its visibility.
5. Drag the mouse to rotate the view, and scroll to zoom in or out.
6. Click the third button on the left to upload your own .glb or .gltf model and see how its shadow appears.
7. Click “Rotate box” to spin the box and watch how the shadows shift with the motion.
